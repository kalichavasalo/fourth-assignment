	<h1>What is vintage photography?</h1>
	<p>Vintage photography is a broad category. It’s not typified by any one technology or technique. It includes every kind of analog photography, from century-old cameras that could live in a museum to cameras that once used Kodachrome and even film cameras from the early 2000s. “Vintage photography is basically utilizing color, black-and-white, or color slide film in an analog camera,” says photographer Jennifer Froula-Weber.</p>
	<p>Photography as a medium is nearly 200 years old, with the first photographs dating back to the early 19th century. During that time, it has evolved and undergone numerous changes, from daguerreotypes on silver plates to tintypes to gelatin glass plates to modern film, including styles from sepia to black-and-white photos to Polaroids.</p>
	<p>Today, nearly all serious photographers use digital cameras, but working with retro technology can still be a fascinating experience for a photographer — one that still delivers stunning, provocative results. Tapping into the history of photography is a great way to liven up a fashion photography shoot or create fun wall art or family photos.</p>
